title: "Latent & Implicit Thinking – Going Beyond CoT Reasoning"
---

We are pleased to announce the **Latent & Implicit Thinking – Going Beyond CoT Reasoning (LIT)** workshop at ICLR 2026. While autoregressive chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning aligns intuitively with human cognition, it may not represent the most efficient or effective internal computation medium for neural networks. Emerging research is exploring alternative forms of intermediate reasoning, including continuous hidden representations, discrete reasoning tokens optimized for efficiency rather than readability, and other non-autoregressive thinking approaches such as diffusion-based thinking. These approaches open up exciting possibilities for more efficient and potentially more capable implicit reasoning in future AI systems. The LIT workshop aims to bring together researchers across the spectrum of implicit reasoning to spark collaboration and accelerate progress in this emerging area.
