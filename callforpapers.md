**CFP: Latent & Implicit Thinking – Going Beyond CoT Reasoning (LIT) Workshop at ICLR 2026**

We invite original research paper submissions on latent and implicit reasoning in vision and language models. The workshop seeks to unify diverse yet complementary research directions exploring alternative forms of intermediate reasoning beyond explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning.

## Submit Your Paper

**[Submit via OpenReview →](https://openreview.net/group?id=ICLR.cc/2026/Workshop/LIT)**

**Submission deadline**: February 5, 2026

**Note for new OpenReview users**: New profiles created without an institutional email will go through a moderation process that can take up to two weeks. New profiles created with an institutional email will be activated automatically. Please create your OpenReview account well in advance of the submission deadline to avoid delays.

## Topics of Interest

We welcome submissions on, but not limited to, the following themes:

- **Training Strategy for Implicit Reasoning**: e.g., curriculum learning, distillation, reinforcement learning, and pretraining from scratch.
- **Looped Architectures**: Recurrence mechanisms (loop unrolling, dynamic halting). Training curricula and stability for deep iterative models.
- **Mechanical Interpretability of Implicit Reasoning**: Layer-wise specialization and attribution of reasoning functions. Causal interventions on intermediate representations.
- **Special Thinking Tokens**: Text CoT compressed to special tokens (e.g., continuous thought tokens, VQ-VAE codes, gist tokens). CoT augmentation via filler or planning tokens.
- **KV-Cache and Hybrid Stateful Reasoning**: Leveraging key/value caches for multi-step latent inference. Comparisons between pure activation vs. cache-augmented loops.
- **Inference Paradigms Beyond Autoregression**: Text diffusion for bidirectional, iterative denoising-based reasoning. Fractal generative frameworks and next-block prediction.
- **Theoretical Results on Depth, Scaling, and Efficiency**: Theoretical bounds on reasoning depth vs. layer count. Parameter- and compute-efficient designs for implicit reasoning.
- **Evaluation and Benchmarks**: Metrics and probes for implicit vs. explicit CoT capabilities. Datasets and tasks that stress ultra-deep or multi-hop latent reasoning.
- **Limitations and Safety**: Understanding pros and cons of implicit and explicit CoT, and interpretability & faithfulness of reasoning from a safety and alignment perspective.

## Submission Guidelines

The workshop will accept papers from preliminary research results and visionary papers to full-length papers. We will host a **Tiny and Short Paper Track** in alignment with ICLR's initiative, explicitly welcoming late-breaking results, replication studies, and conceptual explorations that may not yet have full-paper maturity. Review criteria will emphasize clarity, originality, and potential impact rather than extensive experiments.

Submissions should follow the ICLR proceedings format and choose the suitable categories as follows:

- **Tiny and Short Paper**: 3-5 pages in ICLR format + references and appendix.
- **Regular Paper**: up to 9 pages + references and appendix.

**Tiny Papers Track**: Since 2025, ICLR has discontinued the separate "Tiny Papers" track, and is instead requiring each workshop to accept short (3–5 pages in ICLR format, exact page length to be determined by each workshop) paper submissions, with an eye towards inclusion; see [https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2025/CallForTinyPapers](https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2025/CallForTinyPapers) for a history of the ICLR tiny papers initiative. Authors of these papers will be earmarked for potential funding from ICLR, but need to submit a separate application for Financial Assistance that evaluates their eligibility. This application for Financial Assistance to attend ICLR 2026 will become available on [https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2026/](https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2026/) at the beginning of February and close early March.

For novelty, the workshop does not accept submissions that have previously been published at ICLR or other machine learning or related venues. For openness, we encourage submissions with sufficient open-source resources (e.g., checkpoint, code, data, training details). We do not allow AI as primary authors for workshop submissions.

All accepted papers will be presented as posters. We will select around 3 papers for short oral presentations and 2 papers for outstanding paper awards with potential cash incentives. To support accessibility, we will publish accepted works on the workshop website and highlight selected tiny papers during the poster session, ensuring visibility for early-stage contributors. While the workshop is non-archival, the workshop webpage will be maintained to hold all related materials of the workshop for future online viewers.

## Submission Site

Submissions will be accepted through OpenReview at: [https://openreview.net/group?id=ICLR.cc/2026/Workshop/LIT](https://openreview.net/group?id=ICLR.cc/2026/Workshop/LIT)

**Important**: New OpenReview profiles created without an institutional email will go through a moderation process that can take up to two weeks. New profiles created with an institutional email will be activated automatically. Please create your OpenReview account well in advance of the submission deadline to avoid any delays.

## LLM Usage Policy

In alignment with the ICLR 2026 Policies on Large Language Model Usage ([https://blog.iclr.cc/2025/08/26/policies-on-large-language-model-usage-at-iclr-2026/](https://blog.iclr.cc/2025/08/26/policies-on-large-language-model-usage-at-iclr-2026/)), our workshop will clearly distinguish between AI-assisted and AI-generated content. **AI-generated papers are not permitted in the tiny or short paper tracks.** We will explicitly prohibit AI-generated submissions in the tiny and short paper tracks, while allowing limited, transparent AI assistance (e.g., for grammar correction or rephrasing) as long as the intellectual contribution and analysis remain primarily human-authored. During the review process, LLMs will not be allowed for automated reviewing or decision-making; all evaluations will be conducted by human reviewers. The organizers may use LLMs only for logistical purposes, such as drafting website descriptions or formatting templates, with full human oversight. Any substantial use of AI tools by authors, reviewers, or organizers must be disclosed in submission metadata or acknowledgments.

## FAQ

##### **Will the OpenReview be open to the public?**

We will implement the following policy:

1. All submissions will be private -- to their respective authors, to the reviewers assigned to review them, and to the workshop organizers -- until the camera-ready due date.
2. We will communicate the accept/reject decisions individually and privately to the respective authors.
3. Accepted submissions (abstract + pdf) will be publicly visible after the notification.
4. Rejected and withdrawn submissions will not become public.
5. Reviews will not be made public. They will be visible only to the authors, the reviewers who will have written them, and the organizers.

##### **Anonymity requirements**

Submissions should be anonymized for a **double-blind review**. We do not set an anonymity period.

That means you must submit your paper pdf with author names and affiliations removed, but you can still share it publicly on platforms like ArXiv or on social media.

##### **Dual submission**

We accept submissions of the following types:

1. Fully original work not under review elsewhere.
2. Work that is under review at another venue (e.g., ICML, ARR, including ICLR 2026). If you submit, make sure you are not violating the submission guidelines and anonymity requirements of the other venue(s).
3. Works accepted at other venues, we still require submitting the paper through the portal and going through the normal reviewing process, to decide if it will be accepted and presented at LIT.

For any other questions, please contact the organizers.

##### **Are we allowed to submit a paper with an appendix?**

Yes, you can submit an appendix but reviewers are not required to review it.

##### **Student Funding**

We plan to offer a limited number of travel grants to support attendees from underrepresented groups, including but not limited to individuals with disabilities, those from developing countries, and early-career researchers facing financial constraints.

##### **Awards and prizes**

We will select around 3 papers for short oral presentations and 2 papers for outstanding paper awards with potential cash incentives. The details will be announced later.
